## Setting Up Splunk Master and Forwarder Servers on EC2 (Linux) in AWS

### 1. Launch EC2 Instances

1. **Splunk Master Server**:
   - Launch an EC2 instance with your preferred Linux distribution (e.g., Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu).
   - Choose an appropriate instance type, configure security groups to allow port 8000 (Splunk web interface) and 9997 (forwarding port).
   - Associate an Elastic IP for a static IP address.

2. **Splunk Forwarder Server**:
   - Launch another EC2 instance with the same Linux distribution.
   - Configure security groups to allow port 9997 (for communication with Master) and 22 (SSH).

### 2. Install and Configure Splunk Master Server

1. **SSH Into Master Server**:
   - Use the private key associated with your EC2 instance to SSH into the Master Server.

2. **Download Splunk Package**:
   - Download the Splunk Enterprise package for Linux:
     ```
     wget -O splunk-8.2.3-cd0848707637-Linux-x86_64.tgz 'https://download.splunk.com/products/splunk/releases/8.2.3/linux/splunk-8.2.3-cd0848707637-Linux-x86_64.tgz'
     ```

3. **Install Splunk**:
   - Extract the package: `tar -xvzf splunk-8.2.3-cd0848707637-Linux-x86_64.tgz`
   - Start Splunk: `./splunk start`
   - Follow the prompts to set admin credentials.

4. **Access Splunk Web Interface**:
   - Open a browser and access `http://<Master-Public-IP>:8000` to access the Splunk web interface.

### 3. Install and Configure Splunk Forwarder Server

1. **SSH Into Forwarder Server**:
   - Use SSH to access the Forwarder Server.

2. **Download Splunk Forwarder Package**:
   - Download the Splunk Universal Forwarder package for Linux:
     ```
     wget -O splunkforwarder-8.2.3-cd0848707637-Linux-x86_64.tgz 'https://download.splunk.com/products/universalforwarder/releases/8.2.3/linux/splunkforwarder-8.2.3-cd0848707637-Linux-x86_64.tgz'
     ```

3. **Install Splunk Forwarder**:
   - Extract the package: `tar -xvzf splunkforwarder-8.2.3-cd0848707637-Linux-x86_64.tgz`
   - Start the Forwarder: `./splunk start --accept-license`
   - Set user-defined credentials when prompted.

### 4. Configure Forwarding on Forwarder Server

1. **Configure Forwarding**:
   - Navigate to `/opt/splunkforwarder/bin`.
   - Add Master's IP as a forward-server:
     ```
     ./splunk add forward-server <Master-IP>:9997
     ```

2. **Supply Credentials**:
   - Supply the username and password created on the Master Server.

### 5. Testing and Integration

1. **Testing with Sample Log**:
   - Download a sample log file:
     ```
     wget https://github.com/elastic/examples/blob/master/Common%20Data%20Formats/apache_logs/apache_logs
     ```
   - Upload the log file to `/home/ec2-user` on the Forwarder Server using `scp` or `winscp`.

2. **Monitor Log File**:
   - Inside `/opt/splunkforwarder/bin`, use `./splunk add monitor` to monitor the uploaded log file.

### 6. Master Forwarding Configuration

1. **Enable Port Listening on Master**:
   - On the Master Server, enable listening on port 9997:
     ```
     ./splunk enable listen 9997
     ```

### Congratulations! You've Set Up Splunk Master and Forwarder Servers on EC2 Instances in AWS.
